          "My Daughter had a motorbike accident at 5.00pm on a Sunday evening. I
          contacted Phils Pick up and was informed that he would contact me when
          he returned from Silverstone. Phil did just that and recovered my
          Daughters Motorbike at 7.00pm on a Sunday evening. That’s what you
          call service. Very impressed with the prompt and professional service
          and would not hesitate to recommend Phil’s Pickup Motorcycle Transport
          to anyone."

          Highly recommend Phil’s Pickup Motorcycle Transport! couldn’t be
          happier with the transport of my bike! Dropped off with less than
          24hrs notice, great communication, 10/10 service, bike was strapped
          really secure and he’s a lovely guy. Couldn’t be happier!

          So broke down last night and called Phil to pick me up as RAC quoted
          arm and a leg to take me home Very happy with the quoted price from
          Phil, fast to reply and to pick up my bike Secured the bike in the
          trailer beyond expectation and covered the tank to protect. Goes above
          and beyond to protect your bike. Will use again and can't recommend
          highly enough, 5*
